# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system in Python. The system recommends movies to users by comparing the features (genres, descriptions, etc.) of movies using cosine similarity. This approach is effective for recommending items with content that matches the preferences of a user.

## Features

- Recommends movies based on content similarity.
- Utilizes cosine similarity to find and rank similar movies.
- Easy to use: Simply input a movie title, and the system provides a list of recommended movies.

## How it Works

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load the dataset and preprocess it to handle missing values, convert textual data to lowercase, etc.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Create a term-frequency matrix to represent movie features numerically.

3. **Calculate Similarity:**
   - Use cosine similarity to compute the similarity scores between the feature vectors of the movies.

4. **Generate Recommendations:**
   - Sort movies by their similarity scores and recommend the top N movies that are most similar to the user's choice.

## Results

The system provides a ranked list of movies similar to the input movie, based on content features.
