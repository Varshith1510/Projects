# Article Summarization

  This repository contains a Python implementation of the Text Rank algorithm, inspired by Google's Page Rank algorithm, specifically for summarizing non-premium articles on Medium. It also includes a web interface that allows users to input paragraphs and obtain summarized content directly.

## Features:
- Summarizes non-premium articles from Medium.
- Utilizes the Text Rank algorithm for generating summaries.

## How It Works:

1. Fetches the content of the provided Medium article.
2. Processes the text to identify the most important sentences.
3. Ranks these sentences using the Text Rank algorithm.
4. Generates a concise summary based on the highest-ranked sentences.
